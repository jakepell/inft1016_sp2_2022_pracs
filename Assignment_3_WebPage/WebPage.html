        <h3>About Neuromorphic Computing</h3>
        <p>The human brain is the most complex computer known to humanity. Equipped with power efficient 
          computation and continuous learning through billions of synapses and neurons, storing information in 
          unique locations of the brain. The brain makes up approximately 2 percent of human body weight,
          yet 
          contains vital functions and qualities that defining our humanity.
          Additionally, the brain has structural 
          properties that enable intelligent processing capable of complex tasks. For these reasons, AI 
          professionals are focusing on replicating the architecture of the brain to bring a similar level of 
          intelligence to computers. Founder and CTO of BrainChip, Peter van der Made expresses, “The brain is 
          the only example that we have of an intelligent system. People have been trying to ‘reinvent’ 
          intelligence ever since the earliest days of computing over 70 years ago.” (van der Made, 2021). This 
          emphasizes how significant the brain Is, consequently prompting professionals to develop such 
          architecture for computing.</p>

        <h3>Unique Properties of Neuromorphic Computing</h3>

        <p>Conventional computers utilising the von Neumann architecture will remain widely used for general 
          purpose tasks.
          Neuromorphic computing introduces unique features that will consequently see AI 
          peruse this architecture for majority of its applications. AI algorithms that compute on such hardware,
          serve the complex demands that machine learning and deep learning require to perform efficiently and 
          effectively. Further discussed in a scientific report, “This ‘von Neumann bottleneck’ is an issue for 
          artificial intelligence algorithms which require reading considerable amounts of data at each step, 
          performing complicated operations on this data, and then writing the results back to memory. It slows 
          down computing and considerably increases the energy consumption for learning and inference.” 
          This further agrees with the point that, in order to advance the complexity and intelligence of AI, a 
          biological approach to computing architecture is crucial to accompanying a similar processing level to 
          the human brain. The importance of intelligent processing is therefore emphasised through the unique 
          degree of neuromorphic computing, achieving biologically structured architecture through artificial 
          brain cells.</p>

        <h3>How it will Revolutionise AI</h3>

        <p>Applications for AI now have the support to excel for advanced applications, not possible on 
          conventional von Neumann architecture. Neuromorphic architecture enables smart applications to 
          perform efficiently, exceeding the processing speed of AI tasks in comparison to conventional 
          architecture.A recent collaboration between Accenture Labs and an automotive client revealed 
          supporting evidence towards the performance of neuromorphic computing. It was demonstrated that 
          a neuromorphic processor recognised voice commands up to 200 milliseconds faster than embedded 
          GPU accelerators, with power usage of 1,000x less.
          Therefore, it can be stated that neuromorphic 
          computers are power efficient, whilst producing faster compute results to conventional architecture.
